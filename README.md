# Pathfinding-Algorithms-Visualizer
Visualizes different search algorithms such as Breadths-First Search, Deep-First Search, A-Star Search and Dijkstra's Search Algorithms for you in a colourful fashion.
Here we are visualizing 4 algorithm 
# 1. Breath first algorithm
# 2. Depth first algorithm
# 3. A-star algorithm
# 4. Dijkstra algorithm 


# How it Works

# 1. We select a start node and end one.
# 2. If we want to add wall we can do it.
# 3 Click on visualize to visualize the algorithm you are in 

It will give you a path between start node and end one

# What you need to run this 

# Software:-
# 1. Pycharm

# Library:-
# 1. Pygame(mainly this library is used)
# 2. Numpy

# To run:-

# Open file in pycharm and run the main.py file
